Welcome to Zamboni!  This is the future version of `addons.mozilla.org`_, which
is based on CakePHP at the moment.  We like this version much better.

We have some good `install docs`_ if you want to try it out.  You can come talk
to us on irc://irc.mozilla.org/amo if you have questions.

Subscribe to our `newsletter`_ by sending mail to zamboni@librelist.com.
